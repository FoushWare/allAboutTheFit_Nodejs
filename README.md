## 1. Introduction

This project is a side project that I have been working on for a while.

i will start from the system design and then move to the development part.

## 2. System Design

- the process of designing a system is
  - Define the problem
  - Define the requirements
  - Design the system
  - Implement the system
  - Test the system
  - Maintain the system

### Define the problem

- first collect requirements from the client by asking questions

  - what is the problem we are trying to solve?
  - How the user will interact with the system?

- we want to build an ecommerce system that will allow users to buy and sell products
- the system will have two types of users
  - buyers

- the system will have a payment system
- the system will have a notification system
- the store will have a rating system
